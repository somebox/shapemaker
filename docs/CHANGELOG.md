# Changelog

Notable changes to Shapemaker. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

While the project is pre-1.0 this file is kept deliberately light: the public
surface is still moving, and git history is the detailed record. From **1.0**
onward every release gets a full entry here, and breaking changes to the
[project format](PROJECT_FORMAT.md) get a migration note.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-30

First working milestone. The Python prototype's shell construction is ported
to a static browser app and validated against the original.

### Added

- `compile(state)` — the single regeneration API shared by the UI, exports,
  and tests. Runs headless; no geometry module imports Three.js.
- Icosidodecahedron frame at the prototype's defaults, resting on a face,
  with an orbiting camera on a millimetre build plate.
- Binary STL export in millimetres, oriented to the chosen resting face.
- Structured validation: invalid input returns messages naming the parameter
  at fault rather than throwing or producing a broken mesh.
- Shape-agnostic `skeleton.js` and `faceframe.js`, so later shape families do
  not require changes to the solidifier.
- Continuous integration: unit and parity tests, deployment path rules, and
  mesh acceptance against the Python reference.

### Verified

- Parity with the prototype at default settings: 7,200 triangles,
  16.150 cm³, pentagon-down height 85.07 mm.
- Eight exported meshes pass watertightness, winding, degeneracy, volume, and
  self-intersection checks.
